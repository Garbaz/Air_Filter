# Air Filter

An air filter consisting of a 120mm PC fan, a [random HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BGN5GTG4), and some 3D printed parts.

To open the .scad files, install [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). If you want to use a different fan or filter, you can customize the dimensions of the 3D printed parts easily (Window->Customizer in OpenSCAD). Then export (F6 and then F7) to STL, slice, and print them :)

To attach the fan, I used M4*10mm screws, but M2/M3 and/or other lengths should also work. To the bottom plate I stuck six rubber feet, but they aren't absolutely necessary.
